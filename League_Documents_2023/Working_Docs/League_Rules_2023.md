### Trades

- The trade deadline is the kickoff of the first game of week 13
- There is no approval authority for trades. However, if a majority of the league suspects collusion, all players involved in the trade will be suspended from use in the team's active roster for a period of two weeks to be served as follows:
  - One week immediately following the ruling
  - Week 16 (the first week of playoffs)
*The consideration of such a punishment should be taken up only in cases of obvious foul play and should be done as promptly as reasonably possible after the disputed trade. The accused team owners have a vote by right. This should create an effective guard against frivolous accusations.*

### Waivers

- The free agent period begins on Wednesday morning at 2 AM, Pacific
- A dropped player is *on waivers* and is not available as a free agent for a period of 2 days
- Roster moves are not allowed for a player once his team has begun a game and will be frozen until the beginning of the next waiver period
