### Trades

- The trade deadline is kickoff of the first game of week 13

  - One week immediately following the ruling
  - Week 16 (the first week of playoffs)
*The consideration of such a punnishment should be taken up only in cases of obvious foul play and should be done as promptly as reasonably possible after the disputed trade. The accused team owners have a vote by right. This should create an effective guard against frivilous accusations.*
